□ Check for data quality issues

Day 3-4:
□ Upload dataset to Kaggle:
  - Go to kaggle.com → Datasets → New Dataset
  - Upload CSV file
  - Title: "Indian Student Career Path Dataset (Post-12th)"
  - Description: Copy from guide PDF
  - Tags: education, career, india, students, recommendation

Day 5-7:
□ Create Kaggle notebook for data exploration
  - Load dataset
  - Show distributions
  - Visualize top career paths
  - Create knowledge graph visualization

WEEK 2: Model Training (Kaggle)

□ Adapt your existing DDQN code:
  - Replace Junyi dataset with this dataset
  - Modify state encoding (use 47 features → compress to 60-80D)
  - Update reward function for career paths
  - Build CareerEnvironment class

□ Train model:
  - 500-1000 episodes
  - Monitor convergence
  - Save best model weights

WEEK 3-4: Streamlit Interface (Local VS Code)

EXAMPLE: How to Use This Dataset in Kaggle
================================================================================

# 1. Upload to Kaggle
#    Go to kaggle.com → Datasets → New Dataset
#    Upload the CSV file

# 2. In Kaggle Notebook:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/indian-student-career/indian_students_career_dataset_synthetic_2000.csv')

print(f"Dataset: {df.shape}")
print(df.head())

# Preprocessing
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Encode categorical variables
categorical_cols = ['gender', '12th_stream', 'school_board', 'career_path_year1']
for col in categorical_cols:
    le = LabelEncoder()
    df[col + '_encoded'] = le.fit_transform(df[col])

# Normalize numerical features
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

numerical_cols = ['10th_percentage', '12th_percentage', 'logical_reasoning']
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df[numerical_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(df[numerical_cols])

# Build knowledge graph
import networkx as nx

G = nx.DiGraph()
for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    trajectory = [
        row['career_path_year1'],
        row['career_year2'],
        row['career_year3']
    ]
    for i in range(len(trajectory)-1):
        if not G.has_edge(trajectory[i], trajectory[i+1]):
            G.add_edge(trajectory[i], trajectory[i+1], weight=1)
        else:
            G[trajectory[i]][trajectory[i+1]]['weight'] += 1

print(f"Knowledge Graph: {len(G.nodes())} nodes, {len(G.edges())} edges")

# Now adapt your DDQN code!

QUESTIONS & TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Q1: Can I increase dataset size?
A: Yes! Run the generation code again with different random seed:
   np.random.seed(43)  # Change seed
   # Generate 2000 more students
   # Append to existing dataset

Q2: How do I handle missing JEE/NEET scores in training?
A: Fill with -1 or 0:
   df['JEE_Main_percentile'].fillna(-1, inplace=True)

Q3: Can I add more career paths?
A: Yes! Edit the career_paths_all dictionary:
   career_paths_all['Science-PCM'].append('Robotics Engineering')

Q4: How to validate questionnaire responses?
A: In Streamlit, add validation:
   if percentage_12th > 100 or percentage_12th < 0:
       st.error("Invalid percentage!")
